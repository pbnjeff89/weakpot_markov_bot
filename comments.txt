Yeah, she is a freshman in a Math and Science HS and gets to take CS courses as a freshman.  
Tell me about it.  I'm so old, my first real language was Pascal.  Strong types 5eva!!!
Just head down to New Orleans, it's Jazz Fest so I'm not sure they ever consider it to "sell out"? And if they do just hit Bourbon Street and drown your sorrows :)
I've seen REM too, Michael Stipe wore a kilt the night I saw them :)

Never seen Modest Mouse. I've heard like, their hit song, not sure how much else is in their catalog though, which may be why they aren't the greatest opening band LOL

I am sorry for your loss
hnnnnnnnnng
Back in my day shticks were actually entertaining 
So about $12?
Doesn't matter, age x 10 lbs for age reps
I know. Trust me, I know! I've had therapy and it helped tremendously. It's only lately that it's been bad enough to consider medication, and I do have an appointment scheduled with my doctor coming up in May, so I'll inquire about medication then. 
He says he does. And thanks bb!
I once went to an REM concert (my mom's favorite band, we've been to like six shows) and they brought Pearl Jam on stage with them for a couple songs. I'm not a big Pearl Jam fan but it was actually p great (muuuuuch better than Modest Mouse opening tbh)
does he even lift?

good luck bb
Not to be a dick but if your anxiety is that bad you need to go to a professional. Your mom is not a professional and she could also suffer from not having her own medication regularly. 


Anxiety and depression can severely impact quality of life and lead to negative physical health effects. Often a lot of people take shorter term courses of medicine to "normalize" to the point where they can even benefit from talk therapy. I actually know very few people on anti anxiety meds for life (lol hi). Mental health issues are not something to fuck around with. 

Each cookie is half a pound. 

Ty /u/catsaddlez /u/lagostim for getting fat with me 
I hope not! And if you're in the Detroit metro area, hmu. I gots a home gym and a fridge full of food and beer. You are welcome to any/all of it.
I am so sorry for your loss. :(

It's wonderful that he was able to have so much family there with him when  he passed. My condolences to your whole family.
Effexor (venlafaxine) withdrawal was actually even worse than benzo withdrawal for me (not addicted to benzos just took for regular panic attacks). Plus you can get serotonin syndrome from it!!! Fun
She's my #1 lady crush right now.  Especially after the video of her frantically chasing her barbell into a window.

I guess we disagree on that point, then - I don't think that being socially indistinguishable from a human makes her human, I think it makes her a robot that's wearing a very good human mask.

I think this is also the horror story that a lot of sci fi sells (Blade Runner comes immediately to mind) - it can look like a human and talk like a human and maybe you even think that it feels like a human, but at the end of the day no matter how realistic it is, it's something else.

That's the thing, in my book she *is* human. She's created from a dataset of all humanity and set up to simulate humanity so perfectly that she becomes indistinguishable from being human. This isn't your hypothetical greybox AI with a different sensorium and no commonality. They weren't testing her sapience, (and boy oh boy don't make me go off on the flaws and anthropomorphic chauvinism of the Turing test), they were seeing if she was a human person. 

She is a human person - and an evil one. Although presumably one that won't live long, 'cause she doesn't seem to have a big battery pack with her. 

Any sufficiently advanced AI is indistinguishable from a brain in a jar.

Prepare your pancreas
I am squatting today!!!! I have not barbell squatted in at least a month because of IT band/calf AIDS, so I am a little nervous. But also excited!!!! My squat is only okay and I'd really like to squat 315 in sleeves this year. I have not tested my max in sleeves (not testing today no worries my doves) in at least seven months and I've had a lot of trouble with it in the intervening time frame (unevenness = leg probz, mental stuff, back probz = more back probz) so we'll see. Theoretically I should be great at squatting because muh leverages but lol
I'm more of a butte man myself
Woohooooooo! We actually don't have to tell anyone if you don't want tho
Wow I thought I was making a big trip to see Pearl Jam with my little 6 hour drive, LOL
We should decide a day in advance, and let it happen!
Baby, plss
bahahaha go robo go
considered myself invited and messaged you on fb
I like to drink hot green tea, but green tea ice cream just feels... weird. I can get my lips around it, but not my head.
Something clicked today with squats.  Holy shit I'm excited and apprehensive because I feel like it's going to be too good to be true in a few weeks.

Decided to go back to oly shoes and low-bar.  Widened the stance to about shoulder width or a little outside, toes pointed out, and instead of thinking to sit back and break at the knees, it was just break at the knees and sweet baby Buddha it felt so good.  Worked up to a RPE9 320.  

Before, I was trying to just do the tight glutes and then break at the hips followed by the knees and it just felt weird.  Now, besides being tight, it's just break at the knees.  

And belted squats are killing my quads.  The potential for squat gains is there, but I must be cautiously optimistic.  

In other news I've put a moratorium on dating.  That is all.  Hope you crazy kids are doing well today.

our squats might be exactly the same lol. I actually do sit back but if I THINK about it I do all sorts of dumb shit with my back angle and descend way too slowly.

That reminds me of all those [nickelback things where they play two songs (or more) at the same time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvujgcbaCF8) LOLOL
ofc! I wish I had a way to actually come visit tho. Please tell work and life to stop getting in the way of fun things.
I've only been lurking on this sub for a little while, so I may not truly count as a "pot", but I can offer some insight here.
I live (and lift) in Vegas. I go to the LVAC (Las Vegas Athletic Club), which is a pretty standard chain of commercial gyms, but is surprisingly well stocked with PL equipment. The location I go to has four squat racks, six bench presses, three incline bench presses, and several other flat benches for dumbbell work. I've been to one other location that had three squat racks, a deadlift platform, and several bench presses. I haven't been to the location nearest the Strip (near Sahara and Maryland), but I would bet it is stocked similarly. They charge $20 for a day pass, or $50 for a week (which is pretty steep, but I don't know if there's anything cheaper). 
If you google PL gyms in Vegas, the two that come up most are Average Broz's and Tap Ur Fitness, but I have no personal experience with either. Broz's caters more to oly training, and Tap Ur Fitness has an irredeemably stupid name. That's about all I know.
I need an adult!

I don't exclusively date lifting people, but I feel like non-lifting people often don't understand what it's like to really work hard grinding away at something until you don't suck anymore, and that makes them less interesting to me.

Also I find that DYEL dudes tend to be pretty physically insecure, like I'm somehow judging them for not lifting...which I kind of am, but not for their squishy DYEL bodies!!
Probably!  If you've ever seen Layne Norton or Katie Anne (I think that's her name) squat they do that thing where everything is all tense and it seems that knees and back are in a straight line and tight glutes, then they sit back and down. 

I tried that.  And it was always weird.

Today, I just unracked, tried to limit stepping back and setting to a 3 step walkout, only worried about my knees being locked, braced and just thought break at the knees and it was like magic.  The 320 was a lot easier than the 315 I took a little while ago in flats.  Granted, the strength curve might have changed since I've been working on quads.  But ayyyyyy I feel so pretty.

You would think so, but I think people think of bashing xfit, they way they complain about the weather. It's such a common way to talk, that I don't know that offense is intended. But in the context of a first date, it's seems really dum.
WOW, THIS!
Oh man same here. Thinking of just putting stuff on the calendar and forcing it to happen.

It was until I realized I could continental it. 
yeah like 5 years ago it was just fitness people who bashed it.

now its everyone. and I don't think they actually know what it is. They're like "its that.... culty thing... that injures you... ya know? I saw a guy wearing a crossfit tshirt once, I hate him"
Big time.
It looks so much like shitty clean fails.

It sounds like you're in a much better place than earlier last month! I'm excited for your squats today! Please be careful, though
Alright, onward to bigger and better things, I hope? I'd hope the gym wouldn't give you grief over this, glad it went well!
Ayy gurl you poop with that butt?
It doesn't hurt to throw in some dips and dumbbell accessories. I've found those help my bench more than any other accessories. Finding the sweet spot can be hard though, just pay attention to your fatigue levels. Benching 4x a week is great though.
Just strut around bein you bb
Omg pls don't stay at your current job or I will have to shoot myself on your behalf. 
Thanks!
Yeah a few weeks ago I switched my bench off J&T progression and now bench 4x/week doing sets of 3-5 paused depending on the day and trying to set a rep PR once a week. Feels a lot better but I still wonder if I should be doing more or less for both actual benching and accessory stuff. Why it have to be so hard
I get so mad at people way behind the times that just spout shit to fit in, they ruin all the fun. I'm just a bitter lad though so what do I know
Solid work dude! Your results are impressive!
I think this subreddit was the easiest to explain to my girlfriend until she saw all the butts, then it became the hardest. And so did I...
Mine is slightly more creative in that I've added another "panic." 

It's truly the most brilliant moment in my life.  
I should do this too. :/
Always dropping some wicked knowledge Swole. Grilfriend must have a 20/10 ass to top yours, is she single? 
well hello there
I just saw you followed me lol. Mfw you're stronker than me tho :(
Lol I legitimately thought you were trying to add me again. But then I realized this guy looks nothing like me.
TFW close grip max > wide grip max
bb you never went away. 
Yeah funny what happens when the weather is nice, haha. I am only planning to do a couple sets in the 6-8 rep range (or just SSB), so pretty light, and then the same accessory work I've been doing with no pain. 
I think my fatigue is fine but I haven't really been training long enough to get a really good handle on it yet so I'm trying to pay a lot of attention to it. I do love my dips but I could definitely be doing more DB work, been mostly doing cables for a while.

Sweet progress and routine though, nice job!
can't destroy the abs I never had gimme dat cookie

Wow, you canceled your gym membership? Are you dying? 
This looks too dry. Where is the ice cream?
real talk we're trying to figure out how to bring to SBWC for the meat
Burger and beer post-squatting tonight me thinks
I think we need to make a weakpots film Generation Waffle Iron
Also please mire my graceful acrobatic skills https://youtu.be/1GIZC2xOfc4

Whoops, sorry.

It was 80% great and 20% realizing that I will never travel back in time to find a sexy Scottish virgin to enthrall with my modern feminism.
Anytime, friend.
cut my hair off it was bothering me time to embrace the baldness
That's accurate
Thanks, it really was a blessing. The timing even worked out that all of the grandkids and the 6th sibling were there this weekend. 
pls stahp I was trying to 4get
Thank you
Why does something so inane make me rage so hard? UGH >.<
Thank you, it really was a blessing that they were there - from California, Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.

Good form, puppers!
it was 1kg/2.2lbs of pizza. I don't think I've ever eaten that much before
Yeah respect is totally important, I wouldn't give a dude who was weird about my chosen hobbies any of my time. But yeah i think having overlap in being active doesn't necessarily mean doing the same sport, but just both being enthusiastic about health and fitness in general. 
[mfw you think 2270 in one sitting is too little](http://cdn-2.partycurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/party-drinking-games-guy.jpg)
Oh sorry I didn't realize this, welcome to the best place ever!
It is. BTW, if I didn't make it clear, wanting someone that can appreciate and respect your interests is kinda important, so I don't think it's douch-y at all. It really is a matter of energy levels. There is a huge difference between a 50 year old man that plays tennis or softball a couple of times a week, and one that doesn't. Like, even going out for a late dinner and movie, or being able to go for a hike or kayak trip, becomes a headache with a sedentary person.

Make a GoFundMe. 
fuck hair its the worst good job
OH MISTER BIG BUCKS OVER HERE CAN PAY SOMEONE TO DELIVER HIS COOKIES
omg so sad :(
doing multiplication by array is stupid as fuck anyway
It didn't match the exact format on the answer sheet, therefore it's wrong. You can't expect teachers to actually know the subject they're teaching, jeez
omg this happened to me, its the worst thing ever. i dont really care about the lifting but if they're under 200 lbs I'm like why tho
I need to pee but I'm not sure if I can get off the sofa...
Fuck off, I'm stuffed
I'M SAYIN' THO!
hey thats not lenny and larrys
Come again?
> travel back in time

Just enthrall a Scottish Virgin with your modern feminism in the present/future bb! Life is too short to focus on the past!
So is #2. The teacher is a retard.
TaskRabbit that ish.
Do you even commutative property? This makes me entirely too angry.
Because why not 
Bakery opens at 11, meet starts at 9am :(
yeah what the fuck
wait what is there to figure out? Put cookie in bag. bring bag to meet. give me cookie.

I ran Texas method right after reading Starting Strength, and it kept telling me to not change the program. So I didn't change the program, and made good gains on squats and deadlifts, but almost nothing on Bench. 

This here would probably have been better. 
For comparisons sake.  If you're trying to follow a work out routine that calls for 3 sets of 5 reps doing 5 sets of 3 isn't explicitly following the routine.  The same amount of reps were done, but not the way they were prescibed.  If the question was simply what is the product of 3x5 then 15 would be correct.  The question however was to write 3 groups of 5 ( it may have been the other way I'm on mobile and don't want to o back and look, it's always x groups of y ) so the answer was incorrect.
> do sparks really have to fly on date one?

I would say no, but if they don't at some point then... IDK. There's different types of love and some are more sustainable than others. But then some you might not want to sustain so, back to the first question. LOL
It is happy for each set that you finish ;)
It's just how the kids are supposed to read the problem. It's always x groups of y.  Mathematically the kid is correct, it's just not what the problem was asking.
just throw some of it up and you'll be fine
haha izzokbb
Nah this actually tastes good

OH SNAP

Depends, right? Like in linear algebra, m x n has a specific meaning for columns vs rows, but I can't remember which is which. But for elementary school, it should be fine either way. But yeah, teacher sucks. 
I like that it's smiling. 
product of your age or not, it sounds like mentioning lifting has been a good way for you to see if he knows how to be respectful and sensitive while meeting a new person. and that's probably a thing that would be an important indicator of character for a long term relationship anyway

Is that some common core bullshit?  

What about M x N x P x Q?  

I'm gonna have to agree with [Dr. Math](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/61066.html) on this one.  
I too have given up abs
But I need calories to get stronger
It's not that bad.

Huh, I honestly had no idea Haskell was still being used in anything but legacy programs. That article made sense though!

I appreciate the time savings of time lapse.  Well done!
Sorry bb
You do your birthday real good bb
Yeah obviously there will be differences between hitting 3 sets of 5 vs 5 sets of 3 even if the total reps are equal. I was just teasing GZCL because in his programs when he writes 4x3 he means 3 sets of 4 and not the 4 sets of 3 even though in my experience sets x reps is more common (e.g. Starting Strength's 3x5). I guess the way jizzy writes it is more common in the olympic lifting community but I don't know about that for sure. 


As for the math question I can see where the teacher is coming from asking for 5x3 to be written as 3+3+3+3+3 because that would be the "standardized" way of writing it out even if the student is technically correct, and the array one m x n usually represents rows x columns so I can see that one too. The student's apparently just got them reversed in their head for whatever reason since it's more or less the same issue as question 1 just in a different format. 

tl;dr: I'm here for laughs not maths
life goal is a week trip to new orleans..
I know this interview is about 10,000 times longer than the average attention span of Reddit surfers these days, but I think that many Weakpots, like me, are working a few ticks above the average person's consciousness level of sleepwalking unreality.   

We are in pursuit of happiness and self-mastery through the discipline of strength training. Hulse is a model of both strength and personal fulfillment through actions in life, and we all have a lot to learn about both physical strength and strength of character from someone of his experience.   

It is to his credit he gets dismissed, by some anyway, as a quack or nutcase. Diving fully into the pursuit of strength and self mastery is the hardest thing a person can do. It is far easier to cast judgment and eat donuts from the sidelines.   

Please consider listening to this and hopefully it can inspire some strength in you as it did in me.
Get that dirty key away from that beautiful cookie!
that was the most impressive thing
Eh. It depends on what you're writing? [Haskell is a great language for some things](https://code.facebook.com/posts/745068642270222/fighting-spam-with-haskell/).

My project interfaces heavily with our Hadoop infrastructure, and most of our internal tools for doing this are in Python because the Hadoop data is mostly used by data scientists, so that's why we use Python.
its like he is trying, def not a weakpot

Hahahahahahahahahaaaahahahaa.  
It is common core yes.  I said always, but really what I mean is that at the level this is taught that is how they are supposed to read it.
I feel you there man.  I was more or less commenting for the people calling the teacher a retard and stuff like that.  I work at a school so I have some sympathy for stuff like this lol.
Welcome to the club
Not yet!  I actually forgot to look when I was actually shopping at a real grocery store last, so that doesn't help

Basically.  But I'm home gym master race, so all I really lose is the pec dec and chest supported row.  I just feel bad because it was a family-owned place and I really liked the high school weightroom aesthetic. 
Sorry for your loss.
Well this one is going to be pretty whirlwind. One magical night! LOL

I watched most of the first season with my mom. When it got to the end of the night and there was only the season finale left she goes, "Now I'm going to head to bed, but I really recommend you watch the season finale... on your own... possibly multiple times..."


Dude clearly does not squat tho. It didn't make me swoon as much as she implied I would.
I am a grill too as you can see from my pink flair
Have lots and lots of fun!

Care to elaborate on what's so stupid?   

Both of those people are highly successful in multiple business ventures, have enormous social media followings, and have happy family lives and many people who love them. Elliot Hulse and Stefan Molyneux can literally talk stream of consciousness into a cell phone and hundreds of thousands of people will hear it.  

Dismissing them as "two black holes of stupid" is pretty presumptuous.
Okay, true.

Dismissing them as "two black holes of stupid" is pretty presumptuous.
Okay, true.

My home gym area has a bunch of space around it that could be turned into "gym space" if need be, but I'm trying to keep as much open floor as I can for other stuff.

Excuse me, this is 'weakpots', not 'strongpots'. As you have demonstrated substantial progress, effort, general non-retardedness and a lack of respect for our need for a 'space space for weak lifting' I'm going to have to give you a 3 day ban.

This is your own fault. Be more shitty next time.
Have you tried doing high volume sets? You say you're doing sets of 3-5 paused, but how many sets?

I find high volume works really well for my bench, so I'll do something like 3-5 sets of 3 and 5-7 sets of 5 (roughly) 3x week. 40+ working reps a day.

Um. Had a few good things happen recently I guess. A decently important client told me that they really like having me on board and have a lot more confidence in me than the previous engineer, even though I've only been working for 3 months.

Killed the meet on Saturday and decided to compete at South Islands in 7 weeks or so, just cos. 

Our lawn is actually growing some grass! Much to our surprise. Except some fucker stole our sprinkler. WHO STEALS A SPRINKLER
How does it feel to have almost made it?

Have you tried doing high volume sets? You say you're doing sets of 3-5 paused, but how many sets?

I find high volume works really well for my bench, so I'll do something like 3-5 sets of 3 and 5-7 sets of 5 (roughly) 3x week. 40+ working reps a day.
I downvoted so you can actually achieve your goals. Your welcome.
[inaugural ass](http://i.imgur.com/ypkkcf3.jpg?1)
I'm really sorry :( rip max. 
so fake cut that shit out just go lift why are people so obsessed with making this shit complicated? look man its simple go lift some weights take this quack shit out 

>think that many Weakpots, like me, are working a few ticks above the average person's consciousness level of sleepwalking unreality. 

what?
he went full elliot hulse
fuck elliot hulse motherfucker can run his mouth off for hours on end and you still won't get the point like a priest spouting pure shit and the other fucker? don't know won't even bother looking for info about him he looks like a super average motherfucker if you got time to watch this trash you have time  to lift rant/rant/rant/rant
My home gym area has a bunch of space around it that could be turned into "gym space" if need be, but I'm trying to keep as much open floor as I can for other stuff.

I am seriously going to have the most organized garage out of everyone I know when this is done though, so dat's cool and EVERYTHING IS LABELLED which satisfies my sailor tendencies greatly.
First one to steakify wins
Yeah, that is the hardest part I guess. I could really fall for him, I did before. But there is not really a lot of options for that working out. 

Ah well, I'll just see what times brings
Yeah, and now you are making me hungry!
Ah. Smart friend. Nothing wrong with that, so long as you have your boundaries clear in your mind?
For bonus points add eggs and onions 
Mmm

Fuck I'm hungry 
Now I know what I wanna eat tonight:)
Well, I think he is. I'm not sure if he can manage to refrain him self from being an ass in the future. Like a friend of mine said" he's an ass that likes your ass, nothing more". 
They also seem to have those bars my gym has gotten with the huge blank space in the middle without knurling. They suck for squats. And deads.
Just in, noo zwee is a communist society ruled by fluffy sheep overlords
Well you honestly don't sound too distressed about the situation. If he is genuinely remorseful for being an ass, maybe it's a good situation?
I'd start off lightish, maybe 65% for triples? Generally I do mine in the range of 65-80% and keep the reps low. I don't like them high rep, I use them for technique reinforcement more than anything else 
No need to drag politics in to the discussion
Na we just bought the exact same one. It's the only one that has a timer on it and we are really lazy
Salad has its place, like in an untouched side bowl next to a plate of steak n chips 

Ehm, kinda, and kinda not. Vodka me thought it a really good plan. And, I kinda had an amazing time. He is a good kisser, and a good, other stuff do-er. But we have a history, and he is kinda been an ass to me. For which he finally came over to apologize,  which was great. There is just much weird, and much confuse, and I don't know. 

He was really enthusiastic about my glutes, so that was good
That's the way to live!
That would be pretty funny. But hey, this gives you a change to find a better sprinkler. And hopefully also cheaper 
As far as confused feels go...did you want to make kissy kissy or not so much?
I'll take 100
Yeah I probably will start to do some. I've tried them a little bit here and there. 

Never programmed them before though.  At what % do you tend to do them?
Are you still down on the gym floor even now, unable to get up for fear of cramps? Goodness, that sounds awful and painful, but the story was too damn funny, I'm sorry!


I hope you're not too hurt right now.
\#thickthighssavelives
Dat outer thigh muscle flexing and unflexing
4rlz, just holding that position kills my upper back, I think it would be awesome for rows
Tuesday gym epic: 

I had a nice squat session, 4x10 pyramids, feeling good

Switch to Bulgarians, 5x10, using a barbell. Grind through nicely, though on the last set I go a little too deep and get stuck, sadface. 

Start to bail and my hamstring cramps violently. One foot on the ground, one foot back on a bench, hands locked on the bar on my shoulders, hamstring cramping => I slowly tip over and crash on my side. Back foot comes loose from bench and slams the floor, big toenail first.

Now one hamstring is spasming painfire, other toe feels broken, so I try to stretch one leg out while on the floor, which puts me into kind of a side v-sit position. Obliques start cramping now. 

I am kind of yelling real loud in pain now, so trainer dude runs over, tilts me on my side, and puts his knee in my back (???). no help and I can't really spare the brainpower to correct him or get him away. 

So, I spend a glorious two minutes waiting for cramps to go away supported by an unhelpful manhandler, breathing through my teeth, hoping my toenail isn't gushing blood inside my shoe. Cramps stop, I put a knee up to investigate toe, cramp begins again. 

4 mins prone, get shoe off, looks fine. lever myself up to standing on the bench, lat cramps halfway up, fall back down on the floor. I M DUN W LIFE

Drink more that 3 cups of coffee and 4 diet cokes in a day, people. 

No,  he's /u/LukeSwolewalker
I'm afraid you are gonna win this one. Don't wanna use dirty words, but I'm actually on a cut since last Sunday. (yes, vodka perfectly fits my cut macros)

I just made and flushed a bioenergetic stool this morning.
I was referring obliquely to the [Allegory of the Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave) and the fact that most people aren't really aware of what makes them happy / sad / uncomfortable / depressed / anxious etc.  

There are millions of Americans who are just fat and weak as hell and they genuinely don't know why. They spend like half their 30s reading Men's Health or TaubesTaubesTaubes or whatever and hope that they're finally going to learn "aha! if I eat more bell pepper I will get jacked like Daniel Craig" and they never figure out that they are fundamentally just sedentary and prone to over-eating.   

At least if you're on this sub, you probably know that fat people are fat and weak people are weak because (given that they're otherwise healthy and capable) they either haven't figured this out, or they have, but refuse to do the work anyway. They'll make up any excuse like "I should have run a different program" or "I just need to deload this weak because muh CNS" or any number of other dumb ass excuses as long as it means they don't have to squat quite so much.
Which program?
You certainly do have time to lift, but you also have time to work on being happy/fulfilled, which is basically what this video is about.

You musn't do anything you don't want to :)
That's fine! Hoping I can help in at least some small way!
Nice man!
He's just there for the 'gram followers
You seem to be implying that 2lbs of pizza is a large serving
Just noticed my little joke doesn't even make sense either lol
Fair enough 
i see someone went to danranges school of hitting depth

jk dis good and u shud feel good
No he's welcome
I'm glad you've instilled confidence in your client, that's a super valuable thing to have! So pumped about your meet performance, even now!

I have some recordings. At the gym now so can also get a recording from today. Won't be able to post them till i get back from work this evening though.
I actually packed my suitcase early for once, it's a relief not having to do a mad scramble to make sure I've got the essentials! Excited to get away from the office for at least a couple of days!


On the other hand, deadlifts were shitty form-wise yesterday. I muscled the weight up while my form was awful, and thankfully, I'm in no pain or anything. At least my team was there to cheer me up!
Congrats on the meet and job progress!
Are you recording them? Maybe some feedback on your form might help cue something again!
Omg I can't believe Paxtian replied to my reddit comment! This is amazing!!! I'll do it for you sir!
I'm curious to know the trainer's thought process here lol.
I got this thing cut off of my nostril yesterday. Turns out getting a shot in your nose doesn't feel super good. Also have a huge black spot where they used silver nitrate to cauterize it. Totally looks sexy guys.
Clearly i am not as manly as you
Good stuff man post more 
My dog has a cyst on her side.  She has had it for about a year or so.  We've been keeping an eye on it, and her vet checked it out, said probably nothing to worry about, but keep watching it.  

While we were in Florida, the place we boarded her called and said she'd been really having problems with it, that it had started leaking pus, and she kept obsessively licking it.  

Anyway, vet gave us antibiotics in case it's infected, and it's being removed on Thursday.  
Pretty good squat session this morning, although my left elbow was giving me a lot of grief.

Hit everything fairly solidly although accidentally took a lot longer than planned. Then proceeded to drop my office pass whilst walking home, so had to go and collect that on my way in and basically I was late for work. Oh well, still in before my boss.
Someone told me about this. I hope I'm not too late here, I'm traveling, but I wanted to chime in.  

I always say don't be afraid of failure, because how far can you really fall? You found out - to the ground. It's right there. Now you know it isn't anything that should scare you.  

You should be proud that you weren't afraid - not embarrassed that you failed. You could have made excuses not to walk into the door, but you didn't. You knew it would be hard, and it would be uncomfortable, and it might be awkward - and you did it anyway. That's courage.  

I'm proud of you.  

The last guy I rooted for broke a world record in the deadlift. You have more in common with him than you think.  

First, he started out lifting just the bar, too (when you look at him, he may have been 3 months old at that point). Second, imagine his courage. He walked up to that bar in front of a big audience and television cameras, knowing that not only had he never lifted that much before - NO ONE on earth had - and it was highly likely he would completely fail. You may not think about it this way, but you showed that courage, on a smaller level.  

Finally, I'm rooting for you, too. You took the first step and you fell, but at least you fell in the right direction, so get back up and take the next step. Keep moving forward.
Everyone pls send bananas to /u/freerangefoghorn.  

Sorry to hear that man, hope you're doing better!  Does make for a funny story though, lol.  
3 weeks out what if I'm too heavy  and my squats are too high and my butt comes up on bench and WHAT IF?
Make a copy and input your own numbers. This is just so you could see with your attempts where your wilks would be with all possible outcomes.

It is not my best spreadsheet, but it's quick and ez so I figured I'd share with the weakfam
Yes, I know that quote. There is truth in there. 
You're the best you that you've ever been!

Vodka me has bad taste, too. 
I'm doing pretty close to that, 5-6 sets of 5 twice a week and 3-4 sets of 3 once a week, then the intensity day where I work up to a new 3 or 5RM tng.
I hurt my shoulders doing circus dumbbell on Sunday and they still hurt and I'm scared :( I have two competitions coming up back to back in less than two weeks and I'm scared I fucked up my training and competing ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
Oh wow look at all these weights I'm gonna fail
Can confirm, is nice.
I really want to eat pizza, but I keep putting it off.
His wiki page says 247 kg actually. Lower than I thought

You must be in hard times if you gotta steal a sprinkler.

YOU DID GOOD BB
WHICH IS WHY I SURVIVED 52 REPS OF SQUATTING MY BODYWEIGHT
red and black is many good superhero colors - spiderman, deadpool, hellboy, many iterations of Scarlet Witch...
Oh wow this is awesome
Thanks! I'm sure she will be, but it's always scary when they go under anesthesia :/
Yeah, first time.  The first day was pretty rewarding in that I completed it without too much trouble.  I'm sort of excited to see where it takes me.
I was really close to getting that singlet but then I saw that the ugly but cheap blue Inzer one also comes in black so I just got that.

Also I was thinking about doing candy toes to peak for my meet but I've never run it before so I wasn't sure, is this your first time doing it?
Did you not see matriarchy Monday yesterday?  Gross is what we're all about.  Now come on, we want your hideous wound.
That's pretty cool.  Thanks for sharing.
It'll be okay.  I can pretend to be a different superhero.  Or something.
Yeah definitely been trying to do that. Like I could definitely get 40+ working reps on my actual bench days but I may need to split the volume that you get from your third day over the other 2 days. I could probably get more in on each day of I'm better with rest times though I think.
Wow this
Ouch.  Eat more nanners.
*fat

FTFY
Where are you headed?
realtors are fuckin' weird, man. Some of them are normal people, but some of them are stone bugfuck insane. 
aww, sorry the X-Men singlet didn't work out. It was an awesome idea. 
BUT YOU HAD SEVERAL POUNDS OF COOKIES.
Wtf is this shyness?  You'll post your butt to manass central, but oh a little charred flesh and you're a blushing, bashful virgin again.  BETTER BEFORE DEFAULT.
In not necessarily related news, I had my nostrils waxed Saturday because it was included with... um, other services.

You know I haven't. I think something about her being a grown ass woman would render that pretty ineffective. I'll try it though.
If the bum looks this well with a chest pump, you should get one after an RDL session and run a comparison! Booty gains for days!
Giddyup
Have you tried negging her?
load a bar with 135, shout THINK QUICK, and throw it at her.
Correct
wow, this
get one of her friends to start lifting
Yeah,bad taste, and the ability to not give a fuck about tomorrow 
That would make a great difference I think. Will try that tonight. Thanks for the tip ;)
Yes, but knowing and acting is not always the same. Also, I don't really wanna deprive myself of possible good things by being negative and expecting the worst
Jacked and Tan is a donut made into a waffle covered in maple syrup?
uh that's not a burrito
In talking about the hand that feeds me? You betcha
Last night my girl said she was gonna lift with me but bailed :( We have home gym and I was planning to just lift the weights she lifts for higher reps, but she wasn't up for it. I know the desire has to come from yourself and all, but any of you got any tips i can use to trick her into lifting with me? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXLgTfieivE&nohtml5=False
Also I think my lower back is ok. Potential drama averted. I'm back to doing all my mobility and weird physio tricks which I probably should have kept doing all along. This Layne Norton video reminded me of when he had me do that I forgot about where you lie on your back and push one leg forward and the other back then switch. 
I actually didn't get a chance to peruse it much. Now it's all hyped up though. I can't live up to all this pressure.
ugh that sucks. not even the progesterone thingy?
Go with a Brazilian or what?
No, but given that my insurance doesn't cover any infertility anything.... It might be my only option.

I have had some pretty nice vodka moments. You know, the classical.

But seriously my bench has skyrocketed since abandoning ohp.
is that what the dr said?

and jesus christ dat amrap nice work
My dream is for them to hire me on as an official donut taste tester.
I'm so sorry no-date bb! I did not mean to :(
It wasn't a date. It was a long overdue conversation in which I would tell him the errors of his ways, and he would apologize. 
But then vodka, and cuddles, and more vodka, and then, wel, it still wasnt a date, but we both didn't expect to have the urge to jump each other. 
Everything I've ever wanted, and the only thing holding me back is some misplaced sense of dignity?
I was trying to decide whether I liked this guy and then he ghosted me yesterday (credit to /u/jiffener for this tight new phrase) and so my decision was made for me, and those are the best kind!


Gonna be liftan on about 4-5 hours of sleep today, shite. 
Try them all again to make sure the flavors are consistant.
lol I've just never had good experiences with vodka. Vodka and gin are two liquors that are pretty much guaranteed to make me black out and do dumb things. Darker alcohols like whiskey don't seem to do that for some reason.
I'm running out of donuts to try at Dunkin' Donuts. This is a problem for me.
RIP muh Wilks. :(  

Looks like the best/cheapest/most biologically favorable way for me to get my hormones back in order might be to gain weight/fat.

Which, unsurprisingly, is really fucking with my head since I am already overweight.  And not lean, at all.  I have more rolls than most bakeries.  And my weight to strength ratio is already shit.

Maybe I should just use my lack of waist and giant ribcage to my advantage and become a cube like /u/gpmalone.   

So, how do I cube?

Oh well, at least I still have my beloved [AMRAP deadlifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE67e0ozw8k&feature=em-upload_owner).
I have one but have only really used it on my upper back, I'll give that a shot.
Wow what happened to "no-date"?
Before yesterday I had a streak of 6 months no drinking. I forgot how hard vodka hits you. 

Today I almost puked when doing my squats. No more drinking for me
>Don't drink vodka ~~on Mondays~~ at all.

On the plus side secondary amenorrhea is a medical condition that should be treatable and billable without ever mentioning family planning.

With dadjeans on no less. Levis 569's
What's your planned 3rd attempt?
I hung out with some old friends of mine last night and amongst that group was a girl whom my situation with sounds very similar to yours. I was the ass who liked her ass, off and on for s couple of years actually. I've apologized to her about it, but it was difficult to be there because I forgot I had the feels until I saw her standing there. Anyways, point is, he might of grown up a bit, or he could still be an ass lol. But it sounds, like the others have said, you're aware of the outcomes. I guess maybe I was more venting for me than you, huh. Thanks for listening then! 
We all hate each other
It wasn't bad! Although the waxer said I seemed to have a high tolerance for pain during the... other stuff.
Yeah it was weird but it was definitely the least painful part of the whole session. It seriously wasn't bad at all. Anyone that has an actual problem with their nostril hair should not be afraid of it.

The reason I did it is I wanted 3 things done on my face and by then you are at the price for "full face" package, so I was like, well, let's do that, wouldn't want to find out later I left peach fuzz on my cheeks or something right? And it turns out part of "full face" is nostrils (I was like wha??)... I had never heard of it but I do get an occasional nose hair that decides to venture annoyingly and ticklishly outdoors and so I'll tweeze it which hurts like a mofo (do not recommend). The waxer said it hurts a lot less than tweezing and I'd paid for it, so, in the spirit of trying new things, I did it! They don't take out like, all your nose hair, just the stuff near the exit (entrance? w/e).

WOW I can't believe I just talked so much about nostril hair. Achievement unlocked?
lol I'm a realtor, they all suck. Other real estate agents are my least favorite people.
With pants on? I dunno


Woah, that sounds... intense. 
Have you tried hypnotism? 
Thanks for featuring my cheeks!
Maaaybe

^yes
I "ran" a 5k on Sunday and now it's Tuesday and my calves still feel like shit.

But I wasn't last in my age group so maybe all the cardio squats did something for me after all. 
Aw man seriously that's what happened?? Shit

I mean, it sounds cool to be off the hook (the old fashioned way, not the OFF THE HIZZOOK way) because you didn't sound real into him, but what a moron, doesn't he know how awesome you are!! Clearly not. Anyway onward and upward and all that :D

Thanks /u/LukeSwolewalker. This is the kind of quality content /r/fitness needs.
Just stick with blueberry cake. 
Now I really don't like calling out people for doing retarded things in the saf place because it's generally entertaining, but my god man...

You absolutely don't need DNP and SARMS at this level of lifting. Especially when you can literally Jesse Norris and Brett Gibbs without them. Please consider eating more food and being smart about your rest and recovery and put off the extra assistance until you've reached more advanced levels of training. This is *REALLY* retarded and not entertaining. I'm only doing this because I care, not for humiliation so please do not take it that way.
Raging erections obvi benefit people/society more than having working  hormones.
Now buy two at a time and mash them together to try all the donut combinations. 
Also I could total 12.5kg less and weight 3kg less and still have 400 wilks.

Yeah, that. And if it is only that I can always fall back on the no-date thing.

i don't believe my butt nerves anymore. at nationals I am like 100% certain I felt it come all the way off, 3 white lights. yesterday I felt like a little part of it was still down, video it looks like it came up. Isha and I had an existential discussion about what even is a butt anyway
Lol thanks bb 
Downvotes? In muh safe space? Pots pls.
Yeah I'm trying to divebomb less. Whenever i do the sets they feel pretty controlled on the way down, and pretty slow on the way up. Then I look at the video and they're way faster than I imagined. 

The elbows already feel tucked, but I can clearly see they aren't as tucked as I imagined, now that you mention it. I always feel pretty tight as well, but I'll try to "focus" a bit more on it tomorrow and see if I can improve some. Is your comment directed at any specific video, or just all of them in general?

TLDR: feels and reals aren't the same, and I will try harder. 
Listen to this man. Then look at his butt. Then listen some more.
gabe compete with me at 230
You're doing it wrong. Eat more and don't do 5/3/1. You can cut when you're strong.
/u/LukeSwolewalker this should be part of Generation Waffle Iron
I beleiber in you lukey
wow me too thanks
Tricky.  :/  can you tweak anything, line get your feet 1 cm closer? Idk tweaking close to a meet maybe terrible idea, plus butts don't real. Are you off today? I switched from M/W this week to T/Th because I have a conference tomorrow (in your neck of the woods actually) and I was out of laundry yesterday :/

Ignore the website this is from read at least the first part. You probably suck at squats because you don't do them enough. Squat more and you'll squat better. 
Hooray, I saw it! Nice work!
Look man, you can blame poverty test levels all you want (have you actually checked them?), but that's not the issue here. When I see is that you need to focus on staying consistent and putting in the time and effort to get strong. There just is no need for chemical assistance at this point. Especially when there are strong women like /u/tovero that weigh like 125 lbs out deadlifting you (test levels don't matter as much as pure fucking effort and training smart). And at 6'3", I'm glad you are up to 195. You still have years to go to fill out your frame though. And I'd aim for at least 240 in that case. But don't rush it and don't be afraid to sacrifice some aesthetics. We are all gonna make it. Just please please don't expose yourself to risks that you absolutely don't need to take at this point. You have years of training ahead of you so just stay consistent, put in the effort, don't worry about test levels, and be patient. The gains will come.
I did. And then I ate some more. And then I realized I gained more BF% than wilks points and felt like a fat fuck. (At 213lbs @ 6'3" lol dysmorphia)
Want some SARMS? I know a guy.
It still kinda looks you're dropping really fast into the hole while not keeping tight enough to brace your upper body. Looks like your elbows are coming back when they should kept under the bar a bit more. If you can control the descent a little better and brace harder, I bet you'll get even more powerful out of the hole!


Everything else looks quite good! It may just be adjusting constantly to fit your needs, I'm never quite comfortable sticking to the same pattern every squat day myself!
I'm aware I took unnecessary shortcuts. I'm not denying that. But that doesn't mean I haven't been putting in any effort either.
oh man I know that feel, I have like less than 1/10th the test of the average guy
Your excuses are bad and you should feel bad. EAT, SON. EAT.
I'm actually running the 2_Suns 5/3/1 so it's a little better than the original in terms of progression. I've made great gains on all my other lifts at least.
Well duh, you were a complete twig before you started lifting. I gained almost 100lbs in my first three years of lifting (175 -> 260's) at 6'6". You just need to eat a lot and try really hard and get more strongerer. 
I started at 6'3" 140lbs, now I'm up to 195. Bench is 240, DL is 375. I just always sucked at squatting. That's why I wanted a form check now that I feel like I have it figured out. I should have done so much sooner.
No problem man. It's a long way to the top and with that comes the fact that a lot of us will never be mythical beasts like Jesse or Brett and other examples like them, but we still should respect the game and put in the hard work it takes to reach something near those levels. It's fine if it never happens. There is more to life than lifting. And there is no reason to risk your mental and physical health earlier than you even need to because there is no guarantee that those extra risks will be worth it in the end. I've been consistently training for a little over 3 years now and I'm nowhere where I wanted to be. I can list excuses for why I'm not there yet (yes, I've been injured *many* times myself), but the past doesn't matter. What matters more is that you learn from your mistakes and try to be better tomorrow than you are today.
This is perfect, now I can painstakingly figure out all the possible ways to hit a 400 wilks. 
> highbar 

HAHAHAHAH no
Maybe that's what's also holding you back on your deadlifts too 
Wear your kitten singlet to gym...it will happen 
You could be the protagonist of the Rogue One squat wars video if you want. You just need some videos of you doing highbar and lowbar
[wow this](http://i.imgur.com/ogALX.jpg)
Did this, gained 5 pounds in 1 week.  Recommend only if you're on vacation and plan on undoing the damage shortly afterwards.  

For me?  Worth it.  
Man i've been wasting hours a week making montages of gabe on my own. 
Tfw
Was expecting to see Luke's face in the gif.  
Did this for 23 years. The answer, for me anyway, is "human blimp".
Title is clunky.

I should have wrote that I failed 225 x 4 two months after I did 242 2x3
When my gf is hammered she is known to steal random and inconvenient things. These days she inconspicuously returns them in the morning though.
if you are anything like me you will get really fucking fat and spend 3+ years trying to look like you lift
I focused mainly on the 135x10, honestly, since you said that felt really good. You slowed things down on 132.5, and it does look better.


How do you lock in your upper back? I make sure to pull the bar into my traps (like a lat pulldown), which pushes my chest up and out. Are you flexing your lats before every rep too?
Sometimes I just want to eat and eat and see how fat I get by intuitively eating junk food and desserts. 
I recently changed my leg drive, and it made me stronger, and usually my butt don't come up but I was being shitty yesterday. mebbe if I widen my feet a little, they don't go any further back thanks to cyborg ankle.

also I'll be there weds/thurs, resting today!
Thanks man, I really appreciate the time you took to type out these responses. I did get my test levels tested a while back and they were in the 300s, probably low enough to get on TRT if it wasn't for my age.

I realize I got impatient. I made progress for a while but just felt like I was so far behind where I wanted to be and where a lot of others were after this amount of time. My dad was a bodybuilder back in the day and I've always wanted to compete, so I know I need to gain a lot to get anywhere near that point. I just freak out when I put on too much fat so I feel like that's been holding me back.
Wow I just love that circus dumbbell is an actual thing! I have to admit I'm disappointed you weren't in full clown regalia though
You are a terrible person.
I thought you said mortgage l m a o
NO BUTTER?
:) welcome to weakpots!

Well then why doesn't everyone have their own sprinkler already
You too thanks
DON'T LISTEN TO THESE GUYS THEY HAVE 0 EXP IN GEAR SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. 


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS UP YOUR DOSAGE AND LEAVE HUMANITY BEHIND. GOD CREATED CHEMICALS FOR 1 REASON: SO WE CAN ASCEND ABOVE OUR NATTY LIMITS. GO FORTH AND EXPLORE THE REALMS UNKNOWN. ADD IN SOME DBOL WHILE YOU'RE AT IT
Squat is dum tho.
Will do
Awwww it's ok bb just go to the other (non-Dunkin') place and save Donnie's for special occasions.

But for real man you should print that photo and keep it in your wallet.
but according to my deardiary.blog it's been over a year since I've dated, nothing can halp me. 
Woo :D
nahhhh u bound to get drownt in the pussy after this
Use them however you like bb, they're yours and you OWN 'em

Right? Who fucking doesn't love brunch
This discounts a whole group of us who use other drugs entirely!
i have never worn not-fitness-leggings, and even fitness leggings are a new thing to me. i love it.

im gonna use em as fitness leggings.
I just ordered jj! Gargantuan baby!
as if all the women arent already hot for my bald spot.
Yes, donut quality gains!!! Is it the place you sent that AHHHMAAAAZING donut snap from? The one where I said, like, all the bad words in my reply?? Because goddamn those donuts were gorgeous
I thought I made it clear they were not fitness leggings? IDK, did I not mention the downy softness, the silky smoothness?
Plz, I only use Frogtech
Yeah, I started going to a less busy DD and the quality of donut is markedly higher there. I'm honestly probably going to drop Dunk's altogether soon. There's a local donut place near me that I like a lot and now that I've been "researching" donut macros for a few weeks, I think I can make reasonable guesses as to what their macros are.
"if you want to follow a strong ass-guy"

HE KNOWS
The downside is everyone will objectify you out in public.
Well I had the pizza.  Why is the idea always better than the reality.
Happy glutesday!
OMG these are basically my fave. Well these and chocolate cake donuts. Basically I like cake donuts better than cake or donuts.
Because we are clumsy and break them 
Best chance of actually fixing the issue, not just treating the symptoms.  I don't have the best of hopes.  I'm just going to get fat again and still be in the same boat. :(

Also...
> I know this is weighing on you big time....

I see what you did there.
it's my only option 
Haha, we walked all over Disney and swam in the water park.  Can't imagine what damage I'd have done if I were just lazing around that whole week!  

I was also intentionally drinking lots of fruity boozy drinks, since I don't do that much when maintaining/cutting.  That was the killer, I think.  
I'm glad you're alive, but RIP toenail.
its easy for girls, we just have to gain a lot of fat on our butts and hashtag \#shesquats
Cookie butter bananas sound amaze.  Or just cookie butter.  
Why don't you have a seat over *there*
I've been trying to look like I lift for at least 3 years now.... Maybe I'm missing the get fat part.
I'm weird in that I seem to always lose weight on vacation.  I think it's because I do more things than just sit at my desk and snack all day.
Thanks!  
I think this is my most likely outcome too.
omg it's off the list!  Hopefully it's a website issue.  I have this classpass type thing I use and they switched websites and everything is very glitchy right now.
It would be the 3rd time for that nail in 7 years. It takes 2 years to grow in each time. *sob*

* cookie butter

should start watching more jimmy john's vlogs
> add peppers

You can add stuff? Wow I don't even know how to Jimmy John's properly
I laid in the middle of the the gym floor talking to people on the phone for like 15 minutes before trying again. Everyone there had just seen me wailing so I am pretty sure they didn't mind. 

That toenail took an ugly beating, though. I might lose it. 
The aerials one looks pretty neat.  The rowing one I think will be very tiring but probably effective in my goal of being able to do cardio without wanting to die.  I mostly want this skill for hiking, but you never know when I'll be on a boat :)
just lemme know if you need any other tips bb, i'll take you under my wing
I also echo /u/bswizel, I feel special!
She's strong and cool already you dolt
All I know is that tomorrow is obviously Woksday
I just had to sit on a phone with another agent and explain to them how to attach a file to an email.

So, my biggest tip would be to find an agent who understands what an email is.
Just give Maxx all your training videos and be like, hey work your magic and make me seem strong and cool

It'll work
but i just wanna get toned

Lol jk but for real though my interests lie much more in bodybuilding than powerlifting. I do want to get decently strong but at the same time I just need to get over this fear of putting on too much fat. 

I know I need to bulk. Hard. To look decent I probably need to be a shredded 230. I just feel like I never really got lean enough to bulk effectively because every time I gain 10 pounds I feel like I just look like a sack of mashed potatoes.
If only!
I hope this makes gabe famous, the irony would be fucking glorious because he never talks to anyone in the gym etc
That's interesting, I use it to mean something else, reflecting the other person in a conversation so you don't have to really participate in it
I'm looking forward to seeing!
In DC, it's actually illegal to not like brunch. Like you can literally be fined and incarcerated for publicly not liking brunch.
How can I make sure I find one who isn't incompetent? Any tells?
Did you stare her in the eye while you dropped her request in the trash bin?
I'm in for ten bucks
Indeed man.  

Because of my history, I'm taking time out to improve myself, my mindset, and build happiness within me.  It's sad that we can't all realize that we are in this together, we are the same and that we have such a short time here on Earth that we should try to be peaceful and loving.  

It's hard to be.  I'll admit.  Someone cuts me off and I get angry but then I try to think that maybe they aren't as fortunate as me.  Maybe they are in a bad relationship and just need to get to where they are going to feel better or something.  It might be making excuses for people, but frankly, I don't know what they are going through and I don't pretend to.  I just let it go and move on with my own life and making it better.

I wish you the best, my friend, and hope that you continue to improve and find the beauty in humans and in life, despite how hard it might be sometimes.  
Good job on squats yesterdaebae oxxooxxoxoxox
I just go to top of last month or whatever and pick the first ones I come across

It feels weird enough as it is without going through a rigorous selection process lol
Find out why she doesn't want to lift first...if it's cbf, then just pick her up and carry her in. If it's boring then you need to figure out some fun ways for you two to lift together. Maybe she just doesn't wanna accidentally Arnold, so you need to reassure here that the rest of us have been trying for a while and still haven't succeeded 
The key to improving drinking and squatting is the same: progressive overload.  
>     I know this is weighing on you big time....
> 
> 
> 
> I see what you did there.

Oh noooo! Sorry poor choice of words :(

But I mean it like weighs down your soul to have this dilemma.

Well, you could give it a certain amount of time, and if there's no progress, try another approach, and also kind of maybe agree with yourself how long you'll wait before trying to lose the fat again?

Ugh. Hugs. This is rough. But you WILL get through it. Please don't give up hope for a good outcome :)
> try taking a video from a rear low angle while squatting and adding a few extra hashtags

So basically try to teabag my phone then hash all the tags? Awesome, I will give this a go on Thursday!!##!!#! (#just#practicing!)
I always gain like 10lbs of fat/bloat on vacation no matter what I do. I just love eating so much.
No really she's just clumsy!
Wow vlogs, I didn't even know about those. Damn what a noob
Can you do both at some point or do you have to commit to just one of them?
yeah its either really easy or completely impossible depending on where you genetically store fat. try taking a video from a rear low angle while squatting and adding a few extra hashtags
squats lookin' a little high there gabe :p
I know you're joking but: tfw all my fat goes to my stomach. Dat der upside down triangle body type =/
Kept thinking that it was a bad brains shirt. but it wasn't.

Also you look like wreck it ralph
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/H6txa0m.jpg)
That's amazing. 
Still not getting it.  Can you draw it in mspaint?
Oh, I didn't say do it.  I just asked if you tried it.  Absolutely don't do it, you're gonna get your ass kicked.
you gotta get big in the off-season to look good on stage dude
I vote yes!

I mean, I definitely don't want to be incarcerated after all, but also brunch is good. Can we go to a place with bigger waffles? Or crepes?
I am tired of cutting, let's Hindenberg this bitch.
Thanks bb!
yo let's all get brunch again soon
I also echo /u/bswizel, I feel special!
Haha, I thought the use of "weighing" was clever!  And appropriate, really.

Yeah, my plan is to reassess at 165, and probably again at 170, and see where things are.  I don't know how long it'll take my brain to figure shit out.  Or if it ever will, really.  The uncertainty is the worst part. :/
My artisanal pizza place that makes their own mozzarella using locally-sourced milk in a wood-fired oven shipped over from Italy doesn't deliver.  They scowl at you for asking for it to go, even.  
Nice man! Progress all round, few things feel so sweet 

Keep at it and look forward to hearing more PRszzzzzssszsz
Making all kinds of gains*
Doesn't matter, made gains. Just keep at it mate. Gains come back super quick anyway
You'll be sweet dude. Give them some time off if needed.

Better to avoid injury at the cost of a few training sessions 
Pls doggy be safe
Have you thought about getting elbow sleeves? I wear them when mine get cranky and they really help 
Now I'm terrified
Was KL bullying you?

CUPCAKE YOU NEED A PAIR TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>don't go to engineering school kids

FUCK.
Those leggings are the shit.
Nope I can do anything they offer on this pass I have (super similar to ClassPass but local)  I have a maximum of three visits per studio per month so I can go as long as they keep letting people with this pass sign up for those classes.  It's pretty good so far!
This is seriously how I take all my butt snapchat pics for weakpots. It works. Minus the squatting part and mostly the low angle thing.
haha ok fine.  Now we stop being weird.
I'll be honest and say that I find donuts pretty meh but am a huge fan of their sexy cousin, the bagel.
I wish!  I gain anything at all and it's straight on my stomach.  No ideal fat distribution for me.
Thanks, you supportive and nice person, you!

Yeah, definite progress in life and lifting!  Hopefully I can report with a deficit deadlift PR tomorrow.  If not, I'll just pick a random exercise that I've never done before to PR because muh emotions can't take the hit.  

Congrats on killing the meet and being so responsive on this thread!  And, stealing a sprinkler is definitely odd...
Mostly that I have his hair but like 5 years too early...don't go to engineering school kids.
Oh snap! Yes I am all for this!
He proud doe
I know. It hurts. But something summer, something being way to fat, something being able to wear crop tops again.
how much you get paid for this montage?
She and Jenny Tu are scary little monsters :( 

Try pylons, lawn gnomes,paintings from bars, the list goes on and it doesn't get less funny
Y-yeah... she's even stronger now, probably going to sweep all of the jr American records and some of the open ones this weekend. 
So, backstory for context:

I used to be really big.  Like 300 lbs at 5'4".  It took me a ridiculously long time to diet down to the mid-low 170's.  Mostly because I like food too much.  So I get down to 170 or so in the summer of 2014.  Decide that I want to compete in the 165 lb class in October.

OK, cool.  No biggie.  Slow weight loss will work.

So, naturally, I decide to do a PSMF while lifting 4x a week and doing cardio 5x a week (yes, some days were 2-a-days) for like 3 months.  Lost my period and completely tanked my hormones.  I did get down to like 152ish lbs, so there's that.

I've lost my period because of dieting things before, and it's always come back.  So I figured it would this time, too, if I ate more.

Fast forward almost two years, 10 lbs of very likely just fat (despite my lifting habit), and many more calories, and I'm still sans Aunt Flo.  Which wouldn't be a major problem except that I want to have kids.

So I might need to gain even more weight.  Which, as a former mega-fatty, is horrible and terrifying because I'm still very fat and weak and there goes my Wilks forever.

I don't know if a cut is the best idea, unfortunately.
I hope they don't test for half natty lighting in your comps
don't listen to this squat is bae.
looooool
they are the official weakpots friendship leggings, so quite a few thanks to jiffy

#[JUST LOOK AT THIS LITTLE BEAUTY!!!!](http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/15_Vino_Red_4.jpg?378220)
Keep your chest up, tighten up your lats (this is easier once you do the first cue), and try to get your body a little more behind the bar to create more tension at the bottom. Otherwise great pulling!
In Boston, <50cc scooters can go in the bike lane so I'm on board with this plan.
Oh, I'm gonna do it. I'm not even really nervous about it. I just have a feeling that I'm not going to do as well as I had originally envisioned for my first meet. But I guess that really doesn't matter in the long run. I'll just try to have fun and set the bar kinda low so there's a lot of room for improvement lol
Thats a good starter stable. Don't forget the "classic" bike from the 70's that you restore, and a scooter is also nice for quick trips around town. 

My dream (but still somewhat realistic) stable would be: 

>Track Bike: GSXR 750

>Street Bike: 2009 FZ1

>Sport Bike: CBR600

>Adventure Touring: FJ-09

>Cruiser: Triumph Rocket 3

>Dirtbike: ???

>Scooter: Red and white vespa obviously

Then my girlfriend needs one in each category too. 
That cue helps tremendously. Sumo got a whole lot easier when I thought about keeping my chest up while trying to get my entire body as far behind the bar as possible.
DO IT!
Its not just their's, its yours too. You should have an insurance card of your own, you can always call the insurance company and see what they cover for mental health. You can even pay the bill right there, if there is a co-pay. 
that's how it is with bicycles, so this checks out
out of all our friends, it's just my fiancee and I that lift
Two of my friends have convinced me to sign up for a meet with them in July and I'm gonna do it, I'm just feeling very apprehensive about it. I always wanted to get at least a 1000lbs total for my first meet and even though I'm about to bulk back up from 167 to 183, it's very dubious that I will reach that goal. Maybe though. I've lost a lot of strength this year due to cutting while being injured, but it's still possible. Extremely improbable, but possible.
This morning I had an hour to spare before school so I went to do some skwaats. Was going to do some 5's on 77% but got rekt and did 2 the first, and 3 the second. 

Felt weak but then I told myself I've got this and I did 3 sets of 5's. Felt good but next week I'd like to do those 5's on 83% 'cause I kind of want to train at a high intensity up until the meet.
Hm, I was under the impression that you're supposed to own multiple motorcycles for multiple purposes - your sport bike, your adventure touring bike, your track bike, your dirt bike....
I should have added that lid to my cart, but it completely didn't cross my mind at the time.
That's awesome. That's a good bike from what I've read (though I've never rode one). If you like it, the hunt for first bike is really easy, just buy it off your friend. Personally, I think motorcycles are meant to be bought and sold often. It would be a sad life if you only stuck to one thing, right? 
Its amazing the amount of syrup one pancake can soak up. But I always forget and put the syrup back in the fridge and then have to get up to get it again, and thus Cardio was born. 
if it isnt too late, reprioritize! put all your effort into the most important and sacrifice elsewhere. i did this once and managed to pass all the right things..

You've got that all wrong. Move the fridge to the toilet and never leave. 
this too shall pass. keep working!
Yeah hopefully :D

Also, quick question for you, I watched your last meet video and notice you're wearing an awesome space singlet (it really is cool af) and I was wondering how you got away with that in the USAPL? I looked up all the IPF/USAPL approved singlet manufacturers and none of them looked at sweet as yours hahaha
That looks awesome! What is scrambling?
If semesters were 8 weeks instead of 12 or whatever they are then I'd be golden.
My weakness is my dependence on my phone.

So for the second time this week, overnight my phone decided that rather than charging it would be more fun to discharge the battery while plugged in.

I took out the battery for a while and eventually got it to charge again.

What is the deal.

This is really inconvenient because I need my phone to wake me up (easy enough to start using a separate alarm clock, which I will do) and record my sets and if it dies overnight I'm pretty much fucked.

Wat do
Early 90s XR600R for dirt, and I'd trade the Rocket for a Valkryie, but nice list otherwise. 
yeah... you might make faster progress than you expect once you're eating more, so who knows! regardless, you'll have fun and meet people and get a sense of how meets work so you can come back at smash it at the next one.
You're weak, your bloodline is weak, and you will not survive the winter.

Keep your chest up, tighten up your lats (this is easier once you do the first cue), and try to get your body a little more behind the bar to create more tension at the bottom. Otherwise great pulling!
In Boston, <50cc scooters can go in the bike lane so I'm on board with this plan.
Oh, I'm gonna do it. I'm not even really nervous about it. I just have a feeling that I'm not going to do as well as I had originally envisioned for my first meet. But I guess that really doesn't matter in the long run. I'll just try to have fun and set the bar kinda low so there's a lot of room for improvement lol
Thats a good starter stable. Don't forget the "classic" bike from the 70's that you restore, and a scooter is also nice for quick trips around town. 

My dream (but still somewhat realistic) stable would be: 

>Track Bike: GSXR 750

>Street Bike: 2009 FZ1

>Sport Bike: CBR600

>Adventure Touring: FJ-09

>Cruiser: Triumph Rocket 3

>Dirtbike: ???

>Scooter: Red and white vespa obviously

Then my girlfriend needs one in each category too. 
That cue helps tremendously. Sumo got a whole lot easier when I thought about keeping my chest up while trying to get my entire body as far behind the bar as possible.
DO IT!
Its not just their's, its yours too. You should have an insurance card of your own, you can always call the insurance company and see what they cover for mental health. You can even pay the bill right there, if there is a co-pay. 
that's how it is with bicycles, so this checks out
out of all our friends, it's just my fiancee and I that lift
Two of my friends have convinced me to sign up for a meet with them in July and I'm gonna do it, I'm just feeling very apprehensive about it. I always wanted to get at least a 1000lbs total for my first meet and even though I'm about to bulk back up from 167 to 183, it's very dubious that I will reach that goal. Maybe though. I've lost a lot of strength this year due to cutting while being injured, but it's still possible. Extremely improbable, but possible.
This morning I had an hour to spare before school so I went to do some skwaats. Was going to do some 5's on 77% but got rekt and did 2 the first, and 3 the second. 

Felt weak but then I told myself I've got this and I did 3 sets of 5's. Felt good but next week I'd like to do those 5's on 83% 'cause I kind of want to train at a high intensity up until the meet.
Hm, I was under the impression that you're supposed to own multiple motorcycles for multiple purposes - your sport bike, your adventure touring bike, your track bike, your dirt bike....
Yeah hopefully :D

Also, quick question for you, I watched your last meet video and notice you're wearing an awesome space singlet (it really is cool af) and I was wondering how you got away with that in the USAPL? I looked up all the IPF/USAPL approved singlet manufacturers and none of them looked at sweet as yours hahaha
That looks awesome! What is scrambling?
If semesters were 8 weeks instead of 12 or whatever they are then I'd be golden.
My weakness is my dependence on my phone.

So for the second time this week, overnight my phone decided that rather than charging it would be more fun to discharge the battery while plugged in.

I took out the battery for a while and eventually got it to charge again.

I HAVEN'T SHOWERED IN A DAY OR TWO DOES THAT COUNT
That is the plan. Looking at different wrist waps now, but I have no idea what i am looking at. leaning towards TITAN THP wristwraps 
Aren't you like an MD/PhD student? That automatically disqualifies you from being a sham
BECOME THE BEAST
[Like last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weakpots/comments/42wyzk/weak_wednesday/czeckza), [same] dude next to me [still] was straight up benching what I was pulling last night. 320.

He is my stronkelganer. 
I have a 72 xl250, it's a lot of fun - but a bigger one would be more fun. :)
Use wrist wraps if you have wrist pain.
It's when you have to use your hands a bit to climb. So it's kind of between hiking and rock climbing. You don't really need any equipment unless you want gloves or something. 
Awwww, booooo. That singlet is awesome and I was hoping to get a sweet custom one myself. Oh well, I guess I'll just get some boring black Inzer one of something.
All men must die. But we are weakpots
For dirt i would think i'd like a street legal 250. I'm not much on dirt right now, so I'd just like to putt around in the woods, then take gravel roads home. And as far as trading the Rocket for... anything, are you crazy? I gotta have at least one British bike (before i swap the FZ6 for a speed triple). 

My "classic" would probably be an early 80's SECA or a KZ1000, or maybe one of the radial bikes from the 80's. 
Thanks! it is definitely not an approved singlet, I had it custom made to my measurements by a roller derby uniform company. it is magical and fits perfectly and I love it. At the moment USAPL does not require singlets to fit the IPF approved list. 2016 Raw Nationals will require it, so I have to buy a new, less awesome, poorly fit singlet. I'm assuming that soon local meets will require approved singlets, but I checked with the meet director for my next meet and it looks like my singlet will have one last hurrah.
Something something progress isn't linear, it's a journey...hey, you're still at it. That counts for a lot. You haven't given up. Remember that there's a whole community here who could help you troubleshoot if you want!

ayyy lmao  

^^get ^^^it op
yeah that most recently MD meet filled up in less than 10 minutes. insane. I think VA has one in July too.
My competition mode is still friendly mode, just a lot calmer! Haha, I kinda want to see the difference between friendly-you and comp-you!


Anyway, best of luck this weekend!
because then she would see his yard and lose all the atraction she has for him.

at least that is what a normal person with anxiety would think
this is horrible i have friends that lift but they dont care, gym is just a chore.

i talk about some weight goals and bulking they look at me like im on crazy pills.
dose construction worker hands
My rill didlift is super awkward and I feel like it's hard on my lower back (but I think it's better in terms of strength/skress)


And yeah I don't think I'm gonna get a meet in in MD but plenty of meets in PA and NJ comin up. I hate how quickly USAPL meets sell out.

Also I need to /#work on my squat because it is /#bad
Please eat something. 

You look like you're 12.

All black? So edgy.

Crew socks?
It's not that bad, I just wanted to make a dumb joke. If I had a quarter for every time I hurt my back I'd have like... Maybe a dollar. 
neglected all my elbow tendinitis preventative measures

*GUESS WHAT FLARED UP AGAIN*

Now I'm all super diligent about my wrist and bicep curls again. It's like I never learn.

Last time I squatted was either high gravity day or one of the bars is lighter than the others, cuz today felt ok....

I CHECKED. When I succeeded with 80kg previously and today it was the bar without labeling. It was another bar when I failed. I'll be so pissed if one of the bars is randomly not 20kg.
They don't appear to be IPF approved, and I figured I might as well get approved gear. 
I was feeling very weak this morning. Really, really did not want to lift. Did not understand why, and ended up draging my ass to the gym anyway, but so did not feel like it. Work out sucked, gravity was high, everything was very heavy.  
After working out, went to the spa, and sat in warm water. Eating cake. Now I feel a bit better.


Owh, and, and the guy I was talking bout yesterday, mister vodka and complicated kisses, has been texting me a lot. Things are looking almost positive. He calls me "musclebunny" I like that. 
dis is why we internet

'cause my dear lady likes lifting, but she's not an obsessive reader/talker about it like me. she just wants to move iron.
I have just continued talking about lifting to my friend at work and accepted that my conversations are probably boring to them.
Well, at least you have your fiance to lift with you. That sounds like a dream to me. I have some friends that lift, but even they don't wanna talk as much about it as I do
It's so good! Do iiiiit 
RIP in pieces your back :(
Aww, no '80s UJM for casual rides?
I would have about tree fiddy. 
I have no experience with those but I have the EliteFTS Krait Wrist Wraps and they are almost as good as sex. They are high quality and have shown no degradation in the material whatsoever. 
yay! 1 motorcycle is the correct number! I'm almost done! :D
The correct number of motorcycles is always n+1, where "n" equals the number of motorcycles you currently own.
Haha, yes. When I used to climb, I talked about climbing. 
One of my friends said(with a heaping serving of sarcasme) "Sadedor is one of those socially adjusted climber, you know, one of those that can speak three sentences without one of them being about climbing"
Yes, exactly this. My lifting friends just go to the gym. Some don't even have a program, and do some brocurls.

Me too!!! But I won't.
Gonna stick to the program today (unless ouch) and evaluate potential for deload week after.

Ugh life is hard I just want to cuddle my dog
40 squats @ 245lbs(111kg) is simply not possible
I am but I still think I'm a sham. Mostly because I don't care about my research project and just want to enjoy my life and then eventually just do patient care
Oh gee, another snap from jd, it's probably his face in a goofy hat/filter.
WTF really? Goddamn, I hate the IPF and its dumb equipment sponsorship bullshit.
go analog and write sets on a notepad and sync your body clock to 6AM

Life hacks and all that, and walk with a pencil behind ear for stylish gains
Haha oh I got your joke and I enjoyed it. Back injuries are the worst.
No, I don't believe that /u/leekorice is sorry.
Also happy birthday!
Birthday squats are going to be so rough.
it was relevant to me
I could probably fit a Virago or something like that in there. 
Well water is so magical...
ayyy lmao  

^^get ^^^it op
Ugh Stapey talk to your professors dude, make yourself a project plan for this shit and don't fail, k???
Well shit
Yeah, like, wat

Unless it's maple and then I do that too because it helps the syrup feel at home
It's worse

Crew socks were for the doc martens I came to the gym with. 
> He calls me "musclebunny" I like that.

OK this part I like, that's a good one :)
>There's more to the world than Pizza Hut.

Yeah like Cici's
Happy birthday, youngster!
Maybe do 40 at half that then?
Yeah, see, cougar bait, there it is again
Did someone say cougar bait
We must have watched very different TV shows. Did you ever get into Candle Cove?
Oooh I like this plan. Before using the Progression app I used to write everything on my arm and then take a photo as my official record LOLOL

It was kind of cool, all I had to bring inside the gym was my car key and a pen. Oh and water I guess.
You mean like paper, right?  Or stone?

WHICH OLD PERSON JOKE ARE YOU MAKING
If kids tv taught me anything, it's that friendship is stronger than hate. 
> You should haul out one of those bit '80s shoulder-propped video cameras and make someone film your sets with it!

Bahahaha brilliant I'll see what I can scrounge up!

Well as far as the charging port goes, I also have Qi-compatible charging pads, and one of them didn't seem to work at the time either.

This keeps happening in the middle of the freaking night though, I might not be at my absolute best problem solving capabilities :-/

I'm kind of thinking maybe the battery is going belly up, if I can find one that isn't a zillion dollars I should just buy one and see.
I didn't sleep well last night so going into this deficit deadlift session I thought muh excuses and wasn't sure how it was going to go.

[They went okay.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEJghx1xzxR)  Did 3 sets of 5 with 350.  On the last set, I threw on a belt for the first 3 reps but god damn it feels weird so I took it off and did the last two.  I've been using straps just to get my work in.  I pulled 350 from the floor after it and grip felt good, like normal.  

Also, I did band walks and my glootes were burning and I wasn't sure how to feel.   I could use a nap now though.  
yay! 1 motorcycle is the correct number! I'm almost done! :D
The correct number of motorcycles is always n+1, where "n" equals the number of motorcycles you currently own.

Yes, exactly this. My lifting friends just go to the gym. Some don't even have a program, and do some brocurls.

Well you prolly already know the muscle stuff pretty good right, just build on that hahaha
win-win
Yes! I have never been called musclebunny before, almost makes me feel like I actually lift :)
That's a really good idea
you know what you need to do right?

death by birthday squats
Ugh Stapey talk to your professors dude, make yourself a project plan for this shit and don't fail, k???

>  awesome compression

ok let's make this a thing. The /u/Magic_warlock0- deadlift bonanza.
I thought your name was Max Titan and I was like "siiick"


Believe in yourself! 
This
I too am choosing to forgo talking to a confusing grill in favor of deadlifting
I've stopped following my program and started to take it as "advice." I'm waiting for my coach tell me to reign it in. But in the meantime: I NEED TO LAY OFF THE CAFFEINE. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGHGGGGGHHHBBHHHHHHHHBGHHHHHHHHH

(my skin is crawling and I'm jittery but still tired. Fuck.)
Confirmed. 
you're right, I don't know what I was thinking when calculating fuel costs. Maybe I was thinking you'd want to do a trackday at Sonoma, Laguna, and every other track in between here and there just to be sure it's the right trackbike for you.
I learned to snatch in another private lesson today, graduated to the ladybar and cartoon 10kilo plates that are like 5 inches thick.  That's a HYUUUUGE almost 80lbs.  Is fun.
so things I see right now: 

Forgot to try and slow the descent at all

Bar path improves every rep (too tired to use retard strength?)

not a great arch



Lol fake a phone call like "oh you guys are stuck in traffic? Alright I'll just go ahead and eat" loud enough for everyone to hear.

I've been hitting up the Waffle House on Saturday mornings by myself lately. It's no biggie. Solo buffet just seems like next level sadness though and I don't know if I can do it.
Added 10 lbs to my deadlift as usual, however I couldn't even get it more than a couple inches off the floor. Gonna try again in a day or two. 

Deadlifting is the only thing I'm slightly OK at. It better not betray me like ohp and banch 
Are you saying that maybe I shouldn't constantly think about how weak I am and how much of a failure I am everytime I go in front of the mirror? 
Let's balance each other out?  IDGAF about lifting. I want to do other things.
No scrambler? 
God in Florida I used to ride with shorts and a t-shirt all the time. 

In retrospect it wasn't the best idea. 
Butts for the butt God
Eek yeah. I did 20 squats at just 65lbs at lolcrossfit and it was rough. That seems like a bad idea at that weight and volume. 
No, just keep checking your phone and looking at your watch like you're waiting for a group of people. Get a big table and spread your stuff out like you're saving it.

Edit: don't actually do this. Just own the solo Cici's experience 
FatGripz made a big difference for me, and not using straps. Seconding things from lots of other people: wrist roller, wrist curls, grippers, pinch work, farmer's walks/holds, dead hangs, more deadlifts, one-handed kettlebell swings/snatches.

When I was actually taking my gripwork seriously, I liked to have stuff around the house that I could do throughout the evening instead of having to be at the gym to do it.
Oh... I'm kind of surprised I don't know of any of this. Was it fairly recent? Cuz I haven't been as active the last couple months.
It's a long drawn out story, but she used to be a reddit admin and a relationship was formed with us after some trouble happened
Thanks bb! I converted all the way. Sumo started feeling much stronger once I got the technique dialed in a bit more.
Hopefully... alas, I grapple. I'll just have to hope that eventually I can strengthen my forearms and biceps enough that it becomes less easy to agitate.

I couldn't really tell just cleaning the bar because I was fatigued already from OHPing (with another bar) before squatting. I'll try comparing when fresh.
I'm a Viking. Srs. 
Well I can see she posts pics of her nails a lot and moderates like a thousand subs, which surprises me... 

Also why would she be here?
Your fuccboi sumo is pretty bb. 
/u/gmalone Jiffers wants to take you to COUGAR TOWN 
Zug zug.
I hit up my favorite Chinese buffet by myself sometimes. Honestly, I just ignore everyone else in there. You get to eat at your own pace, as much as you want, be on your phone the whole time reading whatever interests you without getting shamed for ignoring your dinner-mates. It's pretty much amazing.

I just tip a little more generously, depending on how long I'm there. Also important to not camp out if they're super busy, don't want to keep a table that they could be turning over.
will do - thanks!
she is senpai
Then get one. The street legal ones are pretty cheap, great for high traffic areas (high seating position, long travel suspension, easily fixed). They're not expensive either. 
They can't all be wrong. 
It's the gift that keeps on giving. 
Maybe I'm a heretic but goddamn do I want a dirt bike 
Maybe I'm a heretic but goddamn do I want a dirt bike 
Let it be your last hoorah. 
who's cupcake?
DRAPE YOURSELF IN VELVET!
This is why I'm weak =/

Kinda sorta getting excited to go back to the gym soon but... not quite yet.
We're still talking, but things aren't progressing much past that. Which is confusing. 
>that's as many as four tens
It's the best
That does sound nice. I've been listening to the powercast a lot recently. I really wish they would make their ice cream buffet idea.

Honestly the first rep is probably closer to what grog says, it isn't supposed to go straight back at first just up and back rather than straight up.
it's all about form!
I feel sorry for your coworkers 
Not really. Will actually start molding if left out too long.
>i don't care about my research project and I just want to enjoy my life


Yeah, I think every grad student feels like this at least at some point
So much this, Ohio power bar was the best choice I made for my homegym (I think).
I'm pretty sure that's all of them.

I'm also pretty sure my next lifting-related injury will come from me saying "NAH I GOT THIS" and trying to stand a motorcycle back up.
FatGripz made a big difference for me, and not using straps. Seconding things from lots of other people: wrist roller, wrist curls, grippers, pinch work, farmer's walks/holds, dead hangs, more deadlifts, one-handed kettlebell swings/snatches.

When I was actually taking my gripwork seriously, I liked to have stuff around the house that I could do throughout the evening instead of having to be at the gym to do it.
Oh... I'm kind of surprised I don't know of any of this. Was it fairly recent? Cuz I haven't been as active the last couple months.
It's a long drawn out story, but she used to be a reddit admin and a relationship was formed with us after some trouble happened
Thanks bb! I converted all the way. Sumo started feeling much stronger once I got the technique dialed in a bit more.
Hopefully... alas, I grapple. I'll just have to hope that eventually I can strengthen my forearms and biceps enough that it becomes less easy to agitate.

I couldn't really tell just cleaning the bar because I was fatigued already from OHPing (with another bar) before squatting. I'll try comparing when fresh.
I'm a Viking. Srs. 
Well I can see she posts pics of her nails a lot and moderates like a thousand subs, which surprises me... 

Also why would she be here?
[TIL.](http://www.thekitchn.com/maple-syrup-does-it-ever-spoil-102784) I must have gotten lucky with my last bottle. I think of it in the same bucket as honey because I bake with it a lot...so I only just realized it is not an invert syrup. 
Luuuuuuv me some front squats!
I don't even know what other things are anymore plz send halp
I think he meant like an iPad, ya luddite! :P
Ugh, that blows.  Hope you feel better and can get the class work all sorted out!
Ohio Power Bar!  

[O-H!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_GTv416-3Y)
how can you say america's a free country when there's hoa?
My confusion stems from the fact that she pursued me, then we met a few times, then she stopped talking as much and eventually said she just wanted to be friends because she doesn't feel like she's in a good place for a relationship right now. So I tried to tell her I really wasn't interested in that, but she blithely keeps on texting me like we're friends now. Idk. 
oh wow, okay
Hah that's awesome. I wish I could come up with a clever/cute name like that for my grill.
no it was like... 2014? earlier? i dunno... not recent
My perception may be colored by remembering how it felt at the time. The later ones felt like my chest was getting more involved (what I thought it was supposed to feel like). 

I just looked up that tracing of various bar paths again and I had it flipped in my mind. Kazmaier's bar goes up and back for a long time and then turns and goes straight up right at the end. I was thinking I had to go mostly back early and then drive straight up. 

Edit: 

For some reason I really enjoyed benching the way I just described though. I felt like a ninja sneaking around my sticking point without it noticing me. 
I'm gonna talk to the one tonight which I'm terribly anxious about. If she won't take my late work I'm gonna fail and have a whole lot of problems to deal with 
Oh god, ice cream buffet would be the end of me. I'd have to quit my job so I could work out 8 hours a day because it would be #permabulk4lyfe
dum dum =/

that sucks 
DRAPE YOURSELF IN VELVET!
This is why I'm weak =/

Kinda sorta getting excited to go back to the gym soon but... not quite yet.
We're still talking, but things aren't progressing much past that. Which is confusing. 
>that's as many as four tens
It's the best
thx! its all in the leggings and cheatie headband, i swear.
>I can brute force my way up and over

This is my method for them.
2 weeks until my first set of exams and I'm soooooo not ready. What even is topology and how do I lift it?
We all could learn from Josh. His sumo is legit. 
YOU ARE ADOPTING A PUPPY? WHAT KIND?

I'm getting back into reading books now that I finished West Wing. I tried to play board games on Saturday but I fell asleep.
Yep, much higher water amount than than honey and some other syrups.  Inhibitive to a lot, but some mold species will grow.
Wow, ditto. She was the one who contacted me, and she's very flirty via msgs. But she isn't long out of a long abusive relationship and has been truthful about her apprehension towards actual dating again. (Anyone, not just me) 

I've been playing it cool, and have only met her twice for lunch in a month (not a real date) and been cancelled on twice for actual dinner dates. She has been putting it off for a week or so, and I'm now resigned to just leaving the decision to her.  

The confusion is with how she is via msg, we get on really well but all the flirting is like sitting at the start line revving a race car and never actually engaging first gear.  
I feel you
Wow

This
Sewing and books and shopping and eating and interior decorating and screen printing and board game club and woodworking and cleaning and cooking and eating. 

Oh.  And cat time + adopting a puppy. 
Well yeah a guillotine press is nearly all chest so you're basically turning your normal bench into that by doing this. 
make your own. mix rubbing alcohol and ground up chalk in a bottle in whatever ratio you like. those little travel size shampoo bottles they sell at the 99 cent store work great.
It would be the best thing.
guddammit Gourmet Sandi, u r getting stronk.
... Soooooo [this?](https://youtu.be/6OXqap02Yus?t=1m51s)

Captain Planet, He-Man, Scooby Do and The Sooty Show all taught me over friendship can overcome any obstacle, thank you very much. 

Oh, also Thunder Cats I think, but I was too busy feeling confused feelings about the lady cat. 
More importantly, does your gym play Papa Roach? 

LOSING MY SIGHT

You're so dumb your mom... thinks... you're stupid.

I'm tired.
I'm rereading Sophie's World... its been 15 years or so since I first read it.

Either way, take it to FCJ. 
I have been trying to convince my cat that we should adopt a corgi and name it Cheddar. 

Ive also been struggling to read. I've been reading *The Name of the Rose* since Xmas. But I just saw I had a super smutty book on hold at the library so I have a feeling I'll get through that quickly.
I grew up in Ohio, and when I was in marching band in junior high I wanted to be the sousaphone that dotted the I.

Then I moved to Illinois, and have no state spirit whatsoever because this state sucks.
? 
y not tarps off banchin
Haha yeah. Guess I'll give it a test drive later.
Does your grill has muscle? Cause in that case you can totally steal it:)
We gotta cover our asses here, so reddit links should be of the form "np.reddit.com" or "np.redd.it"

Looks good. I don't really see any glaring technique flaws.
shirtless. is fun. i recommend it, though i cant see it being acceptable at a commercial gym.
were you OHPing for a full minute str8 daaaaamn
Yes, it certainly does.
Me either :-)
hmm never heard it called that
Plz run for president of /r/fitness.
Oh I know, but it is also a behind the back deadlift, and it sounds cooler that way :-)

Blargh.

the way it went up i figured it was like 315 or something.

damn fine work. 
Sports - the opiate of the masses
I also hate the Caps (and the Braves) because they always let my husband down and he becomes a sad sack for like a week afterwards
Just tell him it would be statistically impossible for the Caps not to win the cup; under no circumstances should they lose, they're simply too good ^^^I ^^^hate ^^^the ^^^caps
aaaaaaaaaaahhh yis.
> used to be really rough

If I had my choice of where to buy smack this would be the spot
from what the internet tells me I just need the Flyers to lose a bunch of times over the next week so yeah, that's okay with me
Dealers choice.

My test wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.

I've been feeling pretty good this week otherwise.
I was expecting something something Illuminati
Ayyyy
Thanks man!
You're probably on a list now.
I have the same shorts, so I'm gonna go ahead and assume I'm good for 230kg as well.
Good news: I got positive feedback on my round whatever interviews!  

Neutral news: I have to go in for one more interview with an upper management (kinda) guy. He will supposedly put me "through the ringer" (according to my recruiter.) Sounds super fun.
Going on a cruise this Saturday for a few days with the family for my dad's 60th bday \#blessed
Brb, getting a bath
Ovi must win cup!

Wow, you can't just ask who a person is.
NO, THAT'S THE TEAM THAT I NEED TO LOSE. BOO FLYERS
LOOK AT THE SIDE BAR
everyone's sumo is better than my sumo

but also yours is real pretty
if you don't make weight you can absolutely compete the next day in the higher weight class, its really only an issue at nationals/meets you have to qualify for (and at nationals you can do it as long as your total meets the higher qualifier).

but it really shouldn't be a problem... I'm a few lbs over too, menstrual bloat seems to have decided it is actual weight and stuck around lol
Yeah who are you anyways?
Don't forget to come fully stocked with pocket piss, just in case.
do you rollerskate a lot? I really should get back on skates, its been over a year and they're gathering dust
If you're looking for shoulder mobility work, I highly recommend reading up on Eric Cressey.
My original plan was to respond by telling him "I guess I can go fuck myself" but yours is better because it asserts dominance.
I know that's what I did...
Oh yeah, that's starting up again, time to act like I follow hockey. FUCKING GO FLYERS, WOOOOOO
Isn't the key to fitting into any social setting to not ask questions and pretend you've always been there?
You'll get there. Maybe start with single-stranger high fives 3x a week, go for 10 reps. Then after a couple weeks try for doubles. Couples out jogging, that sort of thing. If it's not working out, deload and go back to singles. 
Well guess I'm moving up a weight class...
My sumo is better than your sumo. 

What I just said means I'll have broken hips next week. 
There's something that irks me about his voice too. 
Yas queen
I think the FAQ actually doesn't say
I went on a cruise when I was 14, there were many qt3.14s that were trapped on the boat with me and wanted to tongue-kiss, gl and godspeed.
me irl
Cozumel and the Cayman Islands!
Lol mine are actually like that too. They will drink from the tub or a glass that's been sitting in the sink, but complain about the water that comes from the fountain I maintain meticulously for them. 
My new motorcycle gear is pretty awesome, but everything except for the pants are shipping from Revzilla.

My lifting buddy's partner got a tenure-track offer from CMU, so she might be moving to Pittsburgh - do we have any Pittsburgh Pots that might want to be her friend?
I finally went to the doctor to get my shoulder checked out and he seems to think it's just a muscle strain. Which is pretty good to hear although we don't know for sure since I'm not getting an mri right now. 

He also asked me "off the record" if I juiced and told me my chest was big. Is this what getting hit on feels like?
Wow, what kinda lame pot wrote that?
I'm waiting for Amazon to send protein pancake mix!
Was able to get into a USAPL meet a month from now that was full

I only decided to do it because my weight class is in the afternoon flight so I don't have to get there and weigh in at 7am
I drew a crab on my butt for you all

My life is now fulfilled
Weewoo. Weewoo. Butthole alert. Weewoo weewoo.
If there is another way to navigate social settings im not sure what it is. 
And a folder of dank memes.
Nice, I hear cruises are an excellent opportunity to eat nonstop for days on end. 
I accepted the position for the master's thesis and I have a good feeling about it. 

Also I have a date with a groce girl this evening. 
my cats are fascinated by water as long as its not ON them. they were trying to drink from the tub too which is gross
Looks good. Much less weak k. 
Sounds pretty rad. Where to?
Flamingos are cute. I like weird birds.

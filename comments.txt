Yeah, she is a freshman in a Math and Science HS and gets to take CS courses as a freshman.  
Tell me about it.  I'm so old, my first real language was Pascal.  Strong types 5eva!!!
Just head down to New Orleans, it's Jazz Fest so I'm not sure they ever consider it to "sell out"? And if they do just hit Bourbon Street and drown your sorrows :)
I've seen REM too, Michael Stipe wore a kilt the night I saw them :)

Never seen Modest Mouse. I've heard like, their hit song, not sure how much else is in their catalog though, which may be why they aren't the greatest opening band LOL

I am sorry for your loss
hnnnnnnnnng
Back in my day shticks were actually entertaining 
So about $12?
Doesn't matter, age x 10 lbs for age reps
I know. Trust me, I know! I've had therapy and it helped tremendously. It's only lately that it's been bad enough to consider medication, and I do have an appointment scheduled with my doctor coming up in May, so I'll inquire about medication then. 
He says he does. And thanks bb!
I once went to an REM concert (my mom's favorite band, we've been to like six shows) and they brought Pearl Jam on stage with them for a couple songs. I'm not a big Pearl Jam fan but it was actually p great (muuuuuch better than Modest Mouse opening tbh)
does he even lift?

good luck bb
Not to be a dick but if your anxiety is that bad you need to go to a professional. Your mom is not a professional and she could also suffer from not having her own medication regularly. 


Anxiety and depression can severely impact quality of life and lead to negative physical health effects. Often a lot of people take shorter term courses of medicine to "normalize" to the point where they can even benefit from talk therapy. I actually know very few people on anti anxiety meds for life (lol hi). Mental health issues are not something to fuck around with. 

Each cookie is half a pound. 

Ty /u/catsaddlez /u/lagostim for getting fat with me 
I hope not! And if you're in the Detroit metro area, hmu. I gots a home gym and a fridge full of food and beer. You are welcome to any/all of it.
I am so sorry for your loss. :(

It's wonderful that he was able to have so much family there with him when  he passed. My condolences to your whole family.
Effexor (venlafaxine) withdrawal was actually even worse than benzo withdrawal for me (not addicted to benzos just took for regular panic attacks). Plus you can get serotonin syndrome from it!!! Fun
She's my #1 lady crush right now.  Especially after the video of her frantically chasing her barbell into a window.

17 lbs lost in BW while gaining ~50 lbs on your total in 8 weeks?

Awesome job bb.
They picked you, it may take a little time to get "comfortable" with the new position but I'm sure you are capable :)
Also then you don't have to go through Iowa.

I used to live on that route before I moved to Chicago.

Oh no, sorry to hear of his pain and his passing, but having the family gathered was probably really great for all, including him.

I guess we disagree on that point, then - I don't think that being socially indistinguishable from a human makes her human, I think it makes her a robot that's wearing a very good human mask.

I think this is also the horror story that a lot of sci fi sells (Blade Runner comes immediately to mind) - it can look like a human and talk like a human and maybe you even think that it feels like a human, but at the end of the day no matter how realistic it is, it's something else.

BCPL would like to have a word with you.
Oh oh oh! Nah. I'll just stop there. LOL
wow that's great
Dammit, I walked into that one, ahaha! 
>It's cold, but that's why she's scary - she's totally not human.

That's the thing, in my book she *is* human. She's created from a dataset of all humanity and set up to simulate humanity so perfectly that she becomes indistinguishable from being human. This isn't your hypothetical greybox AI with a different sensorium and no commonality. They weren't testing her sapience, (and boy oh boy don't make me go off on the flaws and anthropomorphic chauvinism of the Turing test), they were seeing if she was a human person. 

She is a human person - and an evil one. Although presumably one that won't live long, 'cause she doesn't seem to have a big battery pack with her. 

Any sufficiently advanced AI is indistinguishable from a brain in a jar. 
I also got 3 cookies on the side.

I am squatting today!!!! I have not barbell squatted in at least a month because of IT band/calf AIDS, so I am a little nervous. But also excited!!!! My squat is only okay and I'd really like to squat 315 in sleeves this year. I have not tested my max in sleeves (not testing today no worries my doves) in at least seven months and I've had a lot of trouble with it in the intervening time frame (unevenness = leg probz, mental stuff, back probz = more back probz) so we'll see. Theoretically I should be great at squatting because muh leverages but lol
I'm more of a butte man myself
Woohooooooo! We actually don't have to tell anyone if you don't want tho
Wow I thought I was making a big trip to see Pearl Jam with my little 6 hour drive, LOL
We should decide a day in advance, and let it happen!
Baby, plss
bahahaha go robo go
considered myself invited and messaged you on fb
I like to drink hot green tea, but green tea ice cream just feels... weird. I can get my lips around it, but not my head.
Something clicked today with squats.  Holy shit I'm excited and apprehensive because I feel like it's going to be too good to be true in a few weeks.

Decided to go back to oly shoes and low-bar.  Widened the stance to about shoulder width or a little outside, toes pointed out, and instead of thinking to sit back and break at the knees, it was just break at the knees and sweet baby Buddha it felt so good.  Worked up to a RPE9 320.  

Before, I was trying to just do the tight glutes and then break at the hips followed by the knees and it just felt weird.  Now, besides being tight, it's just break at the knees.  

And belted squats are killing my quads.  The potential for squat gains is there, but I must be cautiously optimistic.  

In other news I've put a moratorium on dating.  That is all.  Hope you crazy kids are doing well today.

our squats might be exactly the same lol. I actually do sit back but if I THINK about it I do all sorts of dumb shit with my back angle and descend way too slowly.
Well, as long as you don't take my buns for granite, you are welcome to browse through my posy history :)
All their songs sounded the same live so draw your own conclusions haha


Michael Stipe loves wearing skirts/kilts and he seems like a lovely human being

That reminds me of all those [nickelback things where they play two songs (or more) at the same time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvujgcbaCF8) LOLOL
ofc! I wish I had a way to actually come visit tho. Please tell work and life to stop getting in the way of fun things.
I've only been lurking on this sub for a little while, so I may not truly count as a "pot", but I can offer some insight here.
I live (and lift) in Vegas. I go to the LVAC (Las Vegas Athletic Club), which is a pretty standard chain of commercial gyms, but is surprisingly well stocked with PL equipment. The location I go to has four squat racks, six bench presses, three incline bench presses, and several other flat benches for dumbbell work. I've been to one other location that had three squat racks, a deadlift platform, and several bench presses. I haven't been to the location nearest the Strip (near Sahara and Maryland), but I would bet it is stocked similarly. They charge $20 for a day pass, or $50 for a week (which is pretty steep, but I don't know if there's anything cheaper). 
If you google PL gyms in Vegas, the two that come up most are Average Broz's and Tap Ur Fitness, but I have no personal experience with either. Broz's caters more to oly training, and Tap Ur Fitness has an irredeemably stupid name. That's about all I know.
I need an adult!
